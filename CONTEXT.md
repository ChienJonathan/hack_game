# Game World

This context defines the language used to describe the command-driven game world.

## Language

**Room**:
A discrete game area that can be entered and revisited. It is represented through a directory-like command path.
_Avoid_: Folder, level (when referring to the loaded area)

**Exit**:
A route from one Room to another Room.
_Avoid_: Door (when referring to the room-to-room connection)

**Locked Exit**:
An Exit that cannot be used until its Room's goal is met, such as defeating a Guard or discovering everything in the Room.
_Avoid_: Closed door

**Tutorial Room**:
One of the Rooms played before room1 that each teach one mechanic and have a Locked Exit until the player has used it.
_Avoid_: Level, demo (when referring to these rooms in the game)

**World Object**:
An entity that exists in a room and has metadata and runtime state. It is not a literal file, and some of its metadata is not exposed through player commands.
_Avoid_: File

**Character**:
An individual person depicted in the game world, such as a player figure or a guard. The term names the depicted person without specifying control, behavior, or how the game represents them internally.
_Avoid_: Sprite (when referring to the person)

**Player Character**:
The Character controlled by the person playing the game.
_Avoid_: Player (when referring to the in-world Character)

**Guard**:
A hostile Character that obstructs the player's progress through a Room.
_Avoid_: Enemy sprite (when referring to the character)

**Weapon**:
A World Object that a Character can equip and use to defeat another Character.
_Avoid_: Equipment (when referring specifically to an object used in combat)

**Health**:
The amount of damage a Character can take before being defeated.
_Avoid_: HP, life (when referring to the glossary term)

**Reach**:
The greatest gap between a Character and a target at which an attack or pick-up can affect that target.
_Avoid_: Range, hitbox

**Attack Cooldown**:
The time a Character must wait after an attack before attacking again.
_Avoid_: Delay

**Discovery**:
The player's in-world knowledge that a World Object exists.
_Avoid_: View visibility (when referring to the player's knowledge)

**Virtual Path**:
A command-facing address that resolves to a room or world object inside the game.
_Avoid_: File path, filesystem path (when referring to the host computer)

**Throw**:
The flight of a World Object from where it is towards a target after the player moves it with `mv`. It ends when the object arrives at the target or at its first Collision; an object that would Collide on the way never reaches the target.
_Avoid_: Shot, launch

**Collider Tag**:
A typed label on a World Object that says what kind of thing it is when it touches another object, such as Weapon, Character or Obstacle. What happens on contact, and whether two objects Collide at all, depends only on the tags of the two objects.
_Avoid_: Hitbox, collision type

**Obstacle**:
A World Object, such as the boulder, that is neither a Character nor a Weapon and that Characters, Weapons and other Obstacles Collide with.
_Avoid_: Wall, solid

**Force**:
A push applied to a World Object for one tick. All movement of a World Object (walking, pursuing, an `mv` Throw) is made of Forces, which add up.
_Avoid_: Speed (when referring to the cause of movement)

**Friction**:
The slowing of a World Object by the ground, as a share of its speed per second. It does not act while the object is in a Throw. Characters' own braking (`frictionAcceleration`) is not Friction.
_Avoid_: Drag (when referring to the ground; drag acts in the air too)

**Collision**:
A touch in which two World Objects push each other apart and exchange motion according to their mass and Restitution. A touch that only triggers an effect, such as Impact Damage, is not a Collision.
_Avoid_: Contact (when the objects exchange motion)

**Collider Shape**:
The outline a World Object collides with: a box (the default) or a circle. A circle matches a round object, so others slide around it instead of catching on corners.
_Avoid_: Hitbox (when referring to the outline's form)

**Restitution**:
How much of the speed with which two objects approach each other is returned after they Collide. The value for a Collision is the product of both objects' values.
_Avoid_: Bounciness, elasticity

**Impact Damage**:
The Health a Weapon in flight takes from a Character it touches, in proportion to the Weapon's speed. It is distinct from the damage of an attack.
_Avoid_: Collision damage, throw damage

**Wildcard**:
A `*` in a Command argument that stands for any run of characters (including none). It is matched against World Object names, not expanded into the typed command.
_Avoid_: Glob (when referring to the in-game `*`)

**Process Definition**:
A reusable description of a behavior that a world object's rules may select.
_Avoid_: Process (when referring to a reusable description)

**Process Instance**:
One runtime execution of a process definition, associated with a world object and having its own lifecycle.
_Avoid_: Process definition

**Simulation Tick**:
A discrete step in which each active Behavior Rule runs its selected process logic for a World Object.
_Avoid_: Frame (when referring to game logic rather than drawing)

**Behavior Rule**:
A condition associated with a world object that selects a process definition.
_Avoid_: File content (when referring to the rule itself)

**Behavior Tree**:
A hierarchical decision tree of composite, decorator, condition, and action nodes that evaluates during a Simulation Tick to select Character behaviors.
_Avoid_: Script, state machine (when referring to the hierarchical behavior tree)

**Command**:
An implemented, allow-listed operation that a player submits to affect or inspect the game world.
_Avoid_: Shell command (when referring to execution on the host computer)

**Command Input**:
A field where the player enters one command. Long commands wrap visually but are still submitted as one command.
_Avoid_: Terminal (when referring to the input field)

**Movement Mode**:
The input state in which keyboard input moves the Player Character and the Command Input does not accept text. It is the state at game start.
_Avoid_: Walk mode, game mode

**Command Mode**:
The input state in which the Command Input accepts text and the Player Character cannot move. Time in the game world runs slower than in Movement Mode.
_Avoid_: Typing mode, terminal mode

**Time Scale**:
The speed at which game-world time runs relative to real time, determined by the current input state.
_Avoid_: Frame rate (when referring to the speed of game-world time)

**Save Slot**:
The single place where the game keeps one saved record of the world. Saving again replaces the previous record.
_Avoid_: Save file, checkpoint (when referring to the place the record is kept)

**Save Point**:
A moment in play at which the game writes the Save Slot. Entering a Room is a Save Point.
_Avoid_: Autosave (when referring to the moment itself)

**Game Over Choice**:
An option offered when the Player Character is defeated: restart from the beginning, or return to the Save Slot's record.
_Avoid_: Continue, retry

**Command History**:
The raw command text the player has submitted.
_Avoid_: Command result log

**Command Feedback**:
A result shown in the game view, either attached to a specific world object or shown as a general message.
_Avoid_: Terminal output
